    Creates a MoviePy VideoClip that applies a circular motion animation on the given image.
    
    The image is first scaled up by 'scale_factor' to provide extra margin.
    Then, a crop window of the original image size is moved along a circular path.
    The circular path is centered in the scaled image, with a radius determined such that
    the crop window always remains within the scaled image.

    :param fps:          Frames per second for the generated clip.
    :return:             A MoviePy VideoClip with the circular motion animation.
